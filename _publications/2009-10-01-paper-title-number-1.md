title: "The Global Allocative Efficiency of Deforestation"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/global-forest-allocation
excerpt: 'Global deforestation drives more annual carbon emissions than the European Union. This dramatic forest loss is often justified through the need for economic development. Optimal forest loss thus depends on the tradeoff of local economic gains and global environmental losses. I develop a general equilibrium framework which captures rich heterogeneity across 1.3 million plots of land and 2 land uses: forest and agriculture. Empirically, I contribute a novel global land use elasticity of agricultural deforestation to land rents of 0.34 (0.01). My prime counterfactual indicates global Pigouvian carbon tax would avert 30% of future deforestation. However, the gains from carbon taxation are non-uniform. I discuss the potential for second-best instruments, through cross-country transfers, to support forest cover. A full 25% of Pigouvian gains are realized when only the US and China tax forest loss at the social cost of carbon and redistributed revenue as a per-biomass annuity. Technically, my model relaxes the usual CRS production function in the trade literature which limits land rents as a share of income. This relaxation uncovers that landowners can accrue large windfall profits from scarcity rents on agricultural land, offsetting much of the welfare lost. Overall, avoided damages (7%, or 2.3 gigatons of carbon dioxide) from deforestation dwarf welfare losses from economic activity.'
