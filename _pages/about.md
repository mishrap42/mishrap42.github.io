Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Economics at the Wharton School currently in my fifth year. My research sits at the intersection of environmental economics and trade with a particular emphasis on deforestation. You can find my current [job market paper](https://mishrap42.github.io/jmp) draft here.
