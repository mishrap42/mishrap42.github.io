Hello! I am a PhD Candidate in Applied Economics at the Wharton School currently in my fifth year. My research sits at the intersection of environmental economics, development, and trade with a particular emphasis on deforestation. You can find my current [job market paper](https://mishrap42.github.io/jmp) draft here. My dissertation committee consists of: [Arthur van Benthem](https://www.arthurvanbenthem.com/) (chair), [Gilles Duranton](https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/duranton/), [Susanna Berkouwer](http://www.susannaberkouwer.com/), and [Ulrich Doraszelski](https://bepp.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ulrichd/).
